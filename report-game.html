        The JavaScript code for the game can be found in the
        <code>game.js</code> file which is in <b>js</b> folder and it is linked

      <h3>Advanced JavaScript such as objects and arrays.</h3>
      <h4>Where are they in the code and why are they needed.</h4>
      <br />
      <h4>Arrays</h4>
      <p>
        The first array is called <code>myObstacles</code> in
        <code> line 55</code> which is used to push objects to the array in
        order to create endless obstacles coming towards the square. The second
        array is in <code>line 58</code> which is located in
        <code>game.js</code> file as both of them. The array holds 6 different
        colors. They are handy in order to change the color of the obstacles,
        button and borders once you pass every 1000 scores in the game.
      </p>
      <h4>Objects</h4>
      <p>
        First, I created variable for components in the game which is located in
        <code>line 55</code>. Then I used the variable for the component
        creation in <code>line 90 - 92</code>. I used an object to create canvas
        and its parameters like context, width, height & other in
        <code>line 98 - 114</code>. To track if the square hits the obstacle I
        used function constructor in <code>line 143 - 163</code>. You can see in
        the code in <code>line 198 - 201</code> I am using objects to push them
        in to the <code>myObstacles</code> array.

        Changes difficulty for each 1000 points scored, the distance between the

        The JavaScript code for the updating new information can be found in the
        <code>leaderboard.js</code>. Once account has between created ranking
        table automatically creates new row in the table with the
        <code>highScore</code> of 0. Table will display You for the username which is loged in.

      <br />
      <p>
        The JavaScript code for the sorting scores can be found in the
        <code>leaderboard.js</code>. Once the score is higher than
        <code>highScore</code> of the user, it automatically updates to the new
        one. For the sorting the scores, I used bubble sort algorithm because
        for me it is less complex sorting method comparing to others. The code
        of the bubble sort function can be found in
        <code>leaderboard.js</code> on <code>lines 17 - 29</code>.
