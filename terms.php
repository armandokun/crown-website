    <h1 >Terms & Services</h1>
    <p>When you press <b>register</b> or <b>login</b>
        buttons you have to make sure that: <br>
        1.  Everyday you will be thankful for the body which lets you to create. To innovate. To improve. To make impact.<br>
        2. Read this. <br>
        “Education then, beyond all other devices of human origin,<br>
        Is a great equalizer of the conditions of men.” – Horace Mann, 1848.<br>
        At the time of his remarks I couldn’t read — couldn’t write.<br>
        Any attempt to do so, punishable by death.<br>
        For generations we have known of knowledge’s infinite power.<br>
        Yet somehow, we’ve never questioned the keeper of the keys —<br>
        The guardians of information.<br>
        <br>
        Unfortunately, I’ve seen more dividing and conquering<br>
        In this order of operations — a heinous miscalculation of reality.<br>
        For some, the only difference between a classroom and a plantation is time.<br>
        How many times must we be made to feel like quotas —<br>
        Like tokens in coined phrases? —<br>
        “Diversity. Inclusion”<br>
        There are days I feel like one, like only —<br>
        A lonely blossom in a briar patch of broken promises.<br>
        But I’ve always been a thorn in the side of injustice.<br>
        <br>
        Disruptive. Talkative. A distraction.<br>
        With a passion that transcends the confines of my consciousness —<br>
        Beyond your curriculum, beyond your standards.<br>
        I stand here, a manifestation of love and pain,<br>
        With veins pumping revolution.<br>
        I am the strange fruit that grew too ripe for the poplar tree.<br>
        I am a DREAM Act, Dream Deferred incarnate.<br>
        I am a movement – an amalgam of memories America would care to forget<br>
        My past, alone won’t allow me to sit still.<br>
        So my body, like the mind<br>
        Cannot be contained.<br>
        <br>
        As educators, rather than raising your voices<br>
        Over the rustling of our chains,<br>
        Take them off. Un-cuff us.<br>
        Unencumbered by the lumbering weight<br>
        Of poverty and privilege,<br>
        Policy and ignorance.<br>
        <br>
        I was in the 7th grade, when Ms. Parker told me,<br>
        “Donovan, we can put your excess energy to good use!”<br>
        And she introduced me to the sound of my own voice.<br>
        She gave me a stage. A platform.<br>
        She told me that our stories are ladders<br>
        That make it easier for us to touch the stars.<br>
        So climb and grab them.<br>
        Keep climbing. Grab them.<br>
        Spill your emotions in the big dipper and pour out your soul.<br>
        Light up the world with your luminous allure.<br>
        <br>
        To educate requires Galileo-like patience.<br>
        Today, when I look my students in the eyes, all I see are constellations.<br>
        If you take the time to connect the dots,<br>
        You can plot the true shape of their genius —<br>
        Shining in their darkest hour.<br>
        <br>
        I look each of my students in the eyes,<br>
        And see the same light that aligned Orion’s Belt<br>
        And the pyramids of Giza.<br>
        I see the same twinkle<br>
        That guided Harriet to freedom.<br>
        I see them. Beneath their masks and mischief,<br>
        Exists an authentic frustration;<br>
        An enslavement to your standardized assessments.<br>
        <br>
        At the core, none of us were meant to be common.<br>
        We were born to be comets,<br>
        Darting across space and time —<br>
        Leaving our mark as we crash into everything.<br>
        A crater is a reminder that something amazing happened here —<br>
        An indelible impact that shook up the world.<br>
        Are we not astronomers — looking for the next shooting star?<br>
        I teach in hopes of turning content, into rocket ships —<br>
        Tribulations into telescopes,<br>
        So a child can see their potential from right where they stand.<br>
        An injustice is telling them they are stars<br>
        Without acknowledging night that surrounds them.<br>
        Injustice is telling them education is the key<br>
        While you continue to change the locks.<br>
        <br>
        Education is no equalizer —<br>
        Rather, it is the sleep that precedes the American Dream.<br>
        So wake up — wake up! Lift your voices<br>
        Until you’ve patched every hole in a child’s broken sky.<br>
        Wake up every child so they know of their celestial potential.<br>
        I’ve been a Black hole in the classroom for far too long;<br>
        Absorbing everything, without allowing my light escape.<br>
        But those days are done. I belong among the stars.<br>
        And so do you. And so do they.<br>
        Together, we can inspire galaxies of greatness<br>
        For generations to come.<br>
        No, sky is not the limit. It is only the beginning.<br>
        Lift off." - <em>Donovan Livingston</em></p>
