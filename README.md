# crown-website
> This website was created due to a given assignment from the first year of the web development module at Middlesex University.

## Requirements

The website should have at least 4 pages:

- An information page about how to play the game and any background information;
- A game page where the actual game will be;
- A user page that player can register and log in/out;
- A ranking page showing the top players and their scores.

The game should be based on these conditions:

- The type and theme of the game is open, but the player must interact the game by typing a command (not mouse or key press), which can be ‘answer A’ in a quiz game or more complex ones such as ‘move north by 3 and attack the knight’; then the game should respond by showing if the answer is correct or character movement and attack animation.

- The game must be implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
