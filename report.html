        <h3>5 or more types of structure elements introduced in HTML5 such as
            ‘header’ and ‘article’. Headings (‘h1’ to ‘h6’) and ‘div’ are not structure elements.</h3>
        <h4>What are the types and where are they used?</h4>
        <br>
        Structure elements that I used on my website:
        <ol>
            <li><span>
                    <</span>header> </li> <p>I used <i>header</i> to identify the header of the most pages. It is
                        in <b>outputNavigation.php</b> file which generates
                        header for the pages when the function is included and called. Opening tag is on <b>line 4</b>
                        and closing tag is on <b>line 28</b> in the <b>outputNavigation.php</b> file.
                        You can find this file in <b>php</b> folder.
                        </p>
            <li><span>
                    <</span>nav> </li> <p>I used <i>nav</i> to identify the footer's navigation. It is in <b>outputFooter.php</b>
                        file which generates
                        footer for the pages when the function is included and called. Opens on <b>line 8</b> and
                        closes on <b>line 25</b> in the <b>outputFooter.php</b> file.
                        You can find this file in <b>php</b> folder. </p>

            <li><span>
                    <</span>article> </li> <p>I used <i>article</i> to wrap the biggest part of text in <b>index.php</b>
                        file. As you guessed,
                        it is in <b>index.php</b>.The structure element type opens on <b>line 27</b> and closes on
                        <b>line 50</b>.</p>

            <li><span>
                    <</span>footer> </li> <p>I used <i>footer</i> to wrap the footer of the page. The code is in <b>outputFooter.php</b>
                        file. You can find it in <b>php</b>
                        folder. It is opened in <b>line 4</b> and is closed on <b>line 27</b>.</p>
            <li><span>
                    <</span>main> </li> <p>I used <i>main</i> to wrap the second part of the <b>index.php</b> file.
                        The code is in <b>index.php</b> file. The opening tag of the <i>main</i>
                        is on <b>line 12</b> and closing tag is on <b>line 25</b>.</p>
            <li><span>
                    <</span>section> </li> <p>I used <i>section</i> to wrap the table content which will be needed
                        later in project in <b>rankings.php</b> file. The opening tag is on <b>line 11</b>
                        and the closing tag is on <b>line 85</b>.</p>

        <h3>Page design: use text, colour, position, and shape formatting to improve page design.</h3>
        <h4>What CSS formatting are used to improve page design? Where are they used?</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Text</li>
            <p>I am using font called - "Montserrat" for the most of the page.
                It is from Google Fonts website which can generate CSS link code for the font implementation
                and uses theirdata base to download the fonts for client in the website. I used other fonts like
                "Arial"
                and a font family called - sans-serif as a font stack in case Google Fonts would not work. For
                the larger text areas I used "Arial" font because I think it is easier to read then the
                "Montserrat". CSS link is in <b>outputHead.php</b> file which you can find in <b>php</b>
                folder. The link itself is on <b>line 16</b>.</p>
            <li>Colour</li>
            <p>I am using colour palette to make the website look similar in all of the pages. The main colours
                are listed below this paragraph. These colours are widely used in 'a', 'p', borders, etc.
                Also, I used couple additional colours to identify hover elements for interactivity. I decided
                to go transparent with the header/navigation just because it looks great for me.
                The same thing goes for background images, I used linear-gradient to make look background darker
                to not distractother people who are visiting the website.</p>
            <img src="ss/colors.png" alt="Color Palette">
            <li id="css-grid">Position</li>
            <p>I have been using CSS Grid and it helped me a lot. It is easy to manage and control position of various
                content. It is everywhere except <b>game.php</b> and <b>rankings.php</b> if not including the functions
                that generates header and footer. The header is center-aligned because of align-item feature that CSS
                Grid has.
                In index.php I used 5-column grid for 5 elements in the header and ended it after main content, below,
                I used 3-column grid as well because putting 5-column to display three columns was not going to happen.
                So, I managed to divide a page between different number of columns.<br>
                I mostly use margin: 0 auto; because it straightens almost any item I wanted during the course work.
                Also, I like the idea of having position:absolute header with transparent background, it looks way
                better then
                just the simple one with the color in there.
            </p>
            <li>Shape Formatting</li>
            <p>I have been using border-radius for user.php, user-register.php and rankings.php. Primerily on input
                boxes, buttons,
                divs and table.
            </p>
        </ol>

        <h3>Class and ID: define and use Classes and ID for group and individual formatting respectively.</h3>
        <h4>what are the classes and ID and where are they used? why the class/ID is needed?</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Class</li>
            <p>Classes are more reusable then ID's because classes are not unique comparing to the other half. I used
                classes
                when I want to position or style all elements together within the same class. Whether it would an
                element in a few pages or
                only one but all headings within the one page or div wrapper with the class. Like <i>div
                    class="grid-container"</i>
                on <b>line 253</b> in style.css, for example. This class is made only for the position and alignment
                purposes. <br>

                <li>ID</li>
                <p>I used ID's to select a certain element to position or change it somehow within the page. For
                    example,
                    <i>.items-in-main p#slogan</i>
                    is changed to have letter-spacing when others do not have it. You can find classes and ids in
                    almost
                    every page of the website.</p>

        <h3>Grid layout: arrange page contents in multiple rows and columns: maximum
            2 marks for using CSS grid and maximum 1 mark for using Bootstrap.</h3>
        <h4>what is the layout method used and which page/where is it used</h4>

        <p>Most of the time, I used CSS Grid layout method. Files like index.php, user.php, user-ranking.php were done
            completely with CSS Grid. I made specific number of columns but auto number of rows because I was adding
            stuff
            and kept changing the row numbers, so I decided that automatically generated rows will save time and
            display
            will be more elastic if I wanted to add something more.
